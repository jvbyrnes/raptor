      "Problem\n",
      "As a matter of fact, about 2.8 million sites are contaminated in Europe and\n",
      "about a quarter with heavy metals. This pollution contributes to a decrease in\n",
      "soil fertility and biodiversity, through strong impacts on micro-biology but\n",

      "the meantime, some metals are necessary to the energy transition as electrical\n",
      "and electronical systems rely on them. \n",
      "Solution\n",
      "Since 2018, Biomede has developed phytoremediation solutions based on nature.\n",
      "Phytoremediation rely on the ability of very particular plants species, called\n",
      "hyper-accumulative, to extract certain elements from the soil. Thanks to\n",
      "varietal selection, this ability is improved to maximize extraction yield and\n",
      "accelerate the depollution of plots of land using only plants. In the same\n",
      "time, each plant when growing extract and stock the target element. Then,\n",
      "Biomede works at separating the metals from the biomass in order to valorize\n",
      "them to create added value in addition to soil remediation. For example, some\n",
      "plant species can be used in cosmetics, textile industry, or biomass-energy\n",
      "and some metals such as copper, nickel, etc that are highly demanded elements\n",
      "in several industries.\n",
      "Phytoremediation is an alternative to soil excavation, consisting of moving\n",
      "large quantities of soil and processing them at specific sites, then bringing\n",
      "in new soil from another location. Here, the soil stays where it supposed to\n",

      "Answer:  ReCognition Circular is a community-focused initiative launched in 2024 to address the issues of digital exclusion and electronic waste (eWaste) through a circular economy model. The project aims to empower economically disadvantaged youth by providing training that enhances their digital skills and equips them with the knowledge to repair and refurbish IT equipment. This dual approach not only reduces the environmental impact associated with the production and disposal of electronics but also promotes social inclusion and economic resilience within the community. By diverting electronic devices from landfills and extending their lifespan, ReCognition Circular is reducing eWaste and minimizing the environmental impact of electronics production. Additionally, by empowering individuals with digital skills, the initiative facilitates their integration into the workforce, fostering economic resilience and social inclusion.\n"

      "Answer:  Molok is a company that provides innovative municipal waste management solutions, particularly targeting areas with larger detached houses. They offer neighborhood collection points that enable residents to sort up to eight types of waste, significantly enhancing recycling efforts. This system can potentially double recycling rates in these areas from approximately 25% to 50%. Molok's semi-underground containers are designed to optimize space utilization and minimize visual impact, incorporating a unique lifting mechanism for efficient waste collection. This approach reduces the frequency of waste collection, leading to operational efficiency and cost savings, while promoting proper waste separation and higher recycling rates. The system supports sustainable waste management practices, conserves resources, minimizes carbon emissions, and fosters positive community engagement.\n"
