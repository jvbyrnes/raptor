      "Problem\n",
      "As a matter of fact, about 2.8 million sites are contaminated in Europe and\n",
      "about a quarter with heavy metals. This pollution contributes to a decrease in\n",
      "soil fertility and biodiversity, through strong impacts on micro-biology but\n",

      "the meantime, some metals are necessary to the energy transition as electrical\n",
      "and electronical systems rely on them. \n",
      "Solution\n",
      "Since 2018, Biomede has developed phytoremediation solutions based on nature.\n",
      "Phytoremediation rely on the ability of very particular plants species, called\n",
      "hyper-accumulative, to extract certain elements from the soil. Thanks to\n",
      "varietal selection, this ability is improved to maximize extraction yield and\n",
      "accelerate the depollution of plots of land using only plants. In the same\n",
      "time, each plant when growing extract and stock the target element. Then,\n",
      "Biomede works at separating the metals from the biomass in order to valorize\n",
      "them to create added value in addition to soil remediation. For example, some\n",
      "plant species can be used in cosmetics, textile industry, or biomass-energy\n",
      "and some metals such as copper, nickel, etc that are highly demanded elements\n",
      "in several industries.\n",
      "Phytoremediation is an alternative to soil excavation, consisting of moving\n",
      "large quantities of soil and processing them at specific sites, then bringing\n",
      "in new soil from another location. Here, the soil stays where it supposed to\n",
